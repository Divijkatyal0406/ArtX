## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
* Due to Fiber's usage of unsafe, the library may not always be compatible with the latest Go version. Fiber 2.29.0 has been tested with Go versions 1.14 to 1.18.
* Fiber is not compatible with net/http interfaces. This means you will not be able to use projects like gqlgen, go-swagger, or any others which are part of the net/http ecosystem.
